        <p>Hello! My name is Jasmine. 
          I'm currently pursuring a Master's in CS at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (2025). I previously graduated from 
          UCLA with a B.S. in Cognitive Science (Computing Specialization) (2021). I'm currently recruiting for Summer 2025 Internships. 
          I previously have experience working in quality engineering. I'm primarily interested in product, analytics, 
          and software engineering (mobile & full-stack).</p>
        
        <p>Pardon the dust. This site is still under construction.</p>
