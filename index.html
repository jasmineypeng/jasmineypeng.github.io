          Hello! My name is Jasmine, and I'm a student based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. 
          <br><br>
          I'm currently pursuing a Master's in CS at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (2025). I previously graduated from UCLA 
          with a B.S. in Cognitive Science, with a Spec. in Computing (2021).  My prior experiences include quality engineering at Veeva 
          Systems (Medical CRM). I'm primarily interested in product, analytics, and software engineering.
